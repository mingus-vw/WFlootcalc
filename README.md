Welcome to my Warframe loot calculator, my endproject! The project is a simple calculator for the free space ninja game called Warframe. Within you will find the option to calculate the drops of 3 selected enemies, view the rates of loot dropped when you have a resource booster, add, remove and favorite new enemies and login/logout/register!


## Installation

To install the project, simply clone the repository onto your computer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mingus-vw/WFlootcalc.git
```

For SQL, personally I used MySQL workbench, just make sure you connect your database with the project, I would reccomend MySQL workbench as I used it for the project.
